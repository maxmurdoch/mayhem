Despite the pretence that Salcombe is year-round a glistening British beach town with white sand and turquoise water.. this was not the scenario waiting for us when we travelled to Devon in early Spring to shoot ‘Teach A Man To Fish’ for Jigsaw Menswear.

Over five days we had to shoot an array of challenging scenes, not just battling the best of the British spring time weather, the surprisingly rough seas of the English Channel but also fitting a crew and cast of eight onto a small crab fishing boat and allowing multiple costume changes!

The final film is a testament to the hard graft of the crew/cast and the effectiveness of sea-sickness tablets! It was a learning experience for all involved and could not have been done without the magnanimity of skipper Jon Dornom and the crew of the Tenacious boat.
