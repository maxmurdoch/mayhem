A huge congratulations to Mayhem Director Tom Day who has been appointed to the 2017 British Arrows Craft Jury! Joining an array of figureheads from the industry he will take part in a number of days judging submissions before the 2017 event in May. A fantastic privilege for which the whole of the Mayhem team wish him the best of luck!
