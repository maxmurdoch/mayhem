Welcome to Mayhem Live!

LIVE is the buzzword of 2017 and a game changer in reaching your audience. 

It has been a busy few months for Mayhem Live, with the team travelling across the globe to stream a number of live events/experiences to Facebook, Twitch & Youtube. 

We have invested significantly in the medium, not only with top-of-the-range equipment, but also in software that gives your viewers the most interactive viewing experience yet. We can create competitions, give-away prizes and host quizzes all alongside our main video stream. 

Be it a concert, a tournament, a debate or event, going live with Mayhem isn't just about streaming content with our award winning crews, but interacting with viewers throughout the stream to maximise reach and influence and grow your brand or event. 

- Live videos on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & Youtube RANK HIGHER than any other type of content in the news feed.

- On average, usersÂ comment over 10 TIMES MORE on live videos than regular videos.

- Facebook Live Videos are also watched 3 TIMES LONGER than regular videos

- 67% of live video viewers are more likely to buy a ticket to a concert or event after watching a live video of that event or a similar one.

We can stream live multiple camera coverage to the world through multiple social media channels or your output of choice with a very small footprint.

We will handle everything from preparing inserts, graphics, music, presenters, scripts and lighting to producing and directing the whole package.
