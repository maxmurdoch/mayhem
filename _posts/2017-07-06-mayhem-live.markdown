Welcome to Mayhem Live!

Live is the social media buzzword of 2017 and a game changer in reaching your audience in a bigger way than ever. Mayhem has invested significantly in the medium, bringing together a dedicated crew working with top of the range equipment allowing us to live stream from anywhere in the world, no matter how big or small, up to 4K! 

Be it a concert, a tournament, a debate or event - we can stream it to your audience and grow your viewership to new levels.

- Live videos on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & Youtube rank higher than any other type of content in the news feed
- On average, usersÂ comment over 10 times more on live videos than regular videos.
- Facebook Live Videos are also watched 3 times longer than regular videos
- Live distribution of information, feedback, changes and updates to your audience with immediate feedback.
- 67% of live video viewers are more likely to buy a ticket to a concert or event after watching a live video of that event or a similar one.

At a fraction of the cost of TV, we can now stream live multi-camera coverage to the world through multiple social media channels or your output of choice. 

Let us build a show for you.

We handle everything from preparing inserts, VTS (video inserts), graphics, music, presenters, scripts and lighting to producing and directing the whole package.
