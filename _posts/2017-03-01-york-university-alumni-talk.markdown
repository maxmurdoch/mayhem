Tom and Ian were recently invited back to their old university in York to give a talk at the department of Theatre, Film & Television. Tom and Ian, along with Dan studied here between 2011 & 2013 where their original working relationship flourished! It was a fantastic afternoon talking to the current students about the wide world of film and television.
