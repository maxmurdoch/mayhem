Last week we caught up with Katie Mitchell, director of 'La Maladie De La Mort' - a multimedia theatre production touring Europe next year created in collaboration with Mayhem. A ground-breaking approach to theatre, the production utilises 3x cameras creating a live feed projected above the stage during the show.

As part of promotional material for the show's tour commencing in Paris in January, Mayhem also created a TVC for French TV channel 'Arte' which will be released in the coming weeks.
