After the success of our advert 'Teach A Man To Fish' last year, it was great to collaborate again with Jigsaw & NFTS to create a new film for this years collection. The advert, directed by Roland Kennedy, takes influences from the spirit and spontaneity of New Wave cinema, which is the inspiration behind Jigsawâ€™s casualwear collection this season. It was produced by Mayhem boys John Higgins & Ian Packard and shot by our DOP Dan Atherton. Check it out!
