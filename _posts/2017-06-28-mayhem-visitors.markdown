On a cloudy day in London it was great to invite two rays of sunshine in the form of blogger 'Where's Mollie?' & photographer Lydia Collins to Mayhem HQ. They were both here to prep an upcoming project with our man Samuel Davies in Wales next week.
We very much look forward to seeing the result guys!
