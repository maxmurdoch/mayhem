Last weekend Tom and Ian went up to York to shoot this years 'Roses' film. Roses is Europe largest inter-university Varsity, held annually between York & Lancaster. It was a fantastic opportunity to collaborate with the amazing Orillo Films (www.orilloproductions.com). The film has now entered post-production, but some photos of the final scene were very much worthy of an upload. Keep your eyes pealed for this one!
