It's been a great first month settling into our new office on Ludgate Hill. With some exciting projects in the pipeline we have had quite a few visitors, so it seems only fair we show off the new roof terrace! 
If you're in the area or you're interested in discussing a new project, why not pop in for a coffee and say hi!
