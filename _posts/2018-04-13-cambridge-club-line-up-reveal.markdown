Simple but effective! Over the course of 90 minutes, the hotly anticipated Cambridge Club Line-Up was patiently teased and revealed live on Facebook. The production engaged thousands of viewers as they attempted to unscramble the mosaic and guess who would be headlining the summer showcase. The wait was well worth it, with Craig Charles, Trevor Nelson and Grabrielle all breaking through their pixilated cocoon to excitedly announce their performance summer at Cambridge's most iconic music platform. Dreams do come true.
