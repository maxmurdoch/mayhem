Last week we went LIVE from Nike HQ in the final episode of the 'Reece's Puffs Breakfast Club' for the NBA Twitch Channel. Hosted by reknowned streamer and influencer GoldGlove, we were joined by two time All-Star & NBA Legend Terrell Brandon and gaming influencer VernNotice. As well as talking and playing all things NBA and 2K, Terrell saw (for the first time) himself in the game.

 A recap video of the stream will be available very soon.
