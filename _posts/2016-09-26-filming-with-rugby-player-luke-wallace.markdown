Last month we had the chance to film with Harlequins rugby player Luke Wallace to kick of our new #mygame series. Utilising a Red Epic Dragon for the day, Director Tom Day worked with Mercieca to create a 40 second spot focussing on the training needs and attitudes required to be a professional rugby player, and how important the focus on your own game is key, however you choose to train.
