Over the last 4 months Mayhem has been working on a series of films ahead of the NBA 2K League launch. 

"The NBA 2K League is a joint venture between the NBA and Take Two Interactive, publishers of NBA 2K. It is a professional esports league featuring the best 2K players in the world."

The NBA tasked us with creating content on the logo designs (created by Rare Design) for each of the 17 teams, plus the league itself ahead of the unveiling last week. 

Mayhem created over 124 deliverables encompassing a variety of lengths and styles suitable for different social and PR channels.

It has been fantastic to see the films feature on such a wide variety of outlets around the web. We are hugely proud of the project and we can't wait to share them with you if you haven't already seen them across social media outlets!
