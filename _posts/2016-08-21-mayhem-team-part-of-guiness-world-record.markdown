The Mayhem team were on hand to film as the world record for the largest rugby scrum was broken
by 1,297 players in Cardiff.

The successful Guinness World Record attempt was organised by the Golden Oldies World Rugby Festival. The players were joined by members of the public, who formed a scrum that spread across the entire length of a pitch.

Legendary Welsh referee Nigel Owens was on hand to officiate, ensuring there was no illegal binding and the scrum half rolled the ball in straight!!
