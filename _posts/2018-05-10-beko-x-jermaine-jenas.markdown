The sun was shining for a great shoot at Hillbrook Primary School in south-west London featuring ex-England footballer and sporting personality Jermaine Jenas. Jermaine was on a mission to spread word of Beko's #EatLikeAPro campaign (as seen promoted by Barcelona FC) which is a drive to educate children to eat healthier. Jermaine got well involved with the kids' PE class (getting beat a few times on the sprint drills!) and also held a Q&A with them all, answering all healthy eating related questions. Safe to say that he has inspired more than a few to take / keep up this lifestyle!
