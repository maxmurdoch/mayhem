On Friday we wrapped on an exciting new project. Although not too much can be revealed for the time being, this fashion film, in partnership with the National Film & Television School and Jigsaw Clothing will be released within the next month so all will be revealed soon! The project was directed by Roland Kennedy, shot by Mayhem DOP Dan Atherton and Produced by Ian Packard and John Higgins.
