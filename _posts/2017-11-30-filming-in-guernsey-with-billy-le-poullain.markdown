Last week the Mayhem team flew off to Guernsey to film with Boxer Billy Le Poullain. Billy is the first even boxer from Guernsey to qualify for the Commonwealth Games which will be held in Australia next year. The film focusses on Billy's 'island mentality' and how this spurs him on in his pursuit of glory. Look out for the film towards Christmas!
